## Introduction
Megaman Adventure is a 3D platformer arena where we fight dangerous robots that threaten to eliminate downgrading mechanicals. We will pass through an arena with various dangerous mechanicals
and as the main character, we have to survive and clear out all enemies. At the end of the journey, we will encounter an enormous mechanical boss, with a large hitbox and higher health bar. As we
take down the final boss, the journey of the Megaman adventure finally comes to an end, with a huge triumph for the main character.
